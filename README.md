# Alexander Mochalov (Junior QA Engineer)

## Summary
A motivated, self-organized person with strong management, communication, and problem-solving skills with constant willingness to learn new things and willing to move further in career and as a person. Recently I discovered for myself the beautiful world of IT and fell in love with the basics of programming. However, I understand that I don't have strong programming skills yet and until I grow to the next technical level I thought that I could enter the IT-sphere as a QA engineer to learn more about IT and to learn IT from a different angle. Interested in getting skills in automating testing and programming in general.
